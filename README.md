# SNAP-Decisions
Addressing health disparities via open source/science solutions

Inspired by a discussion about how society uses food to deny low-income households their dignity and humanity by setting restrictions on what food-stamp (SNAP) users can and cannot eat. I want to help low-income households make nutritional decisions and give people back the choices that SNAP-program/food stamp restrictions create. 

This might entail creating a personalized interface based on an entered zipcode and the SNAP-applicable grocery location circulars/coupons, or the AmazonFresh pilot program to address food deserts and giving personalized profile recommendations on what a user may want to efficiently purchase using their SNAP/EBT benefits. Another option includes creating a "honey" style chrome extension that assesses the cost and health efficiency of the groceries.

Current Issues being addressed: socioeconomic and financial situations that perpetuate health disparities and the associated stigma. Additionally gives support to the pilot program that AmazonFresh currently offers (but also currently limits SNAP users that can benefit).  

Tech Help: Data mining through existing nutrition options (AmazonFresh, grocery circulars/coupons), backend database development, database query management of the nutrition options, front-end development of a good UI/UX experience.
